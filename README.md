Simple Windows (bat) scripts to make task easier :-)
Use them by placing in the ADB (& fastboot) folder binary
These are for My Personal Use

1. Motorola_De-Bloater : Debloat the Stock Motorola Firmwares (Android 6.0 - Android 8.1)

2. GreefifyPermisssions : Grant permissions for Greenify for Non-Rooted Devices

3. Phone_and_Messages_delete : Delete the Call history, Messages and Contacts without the need of Factory Reset Data

4. Remove_Space : Renames the Spaces (' ') between the file names (for all files in a folder) to underscore ('_')

5. copy_sdcard : Copy the Phone's whole Internal Memory
